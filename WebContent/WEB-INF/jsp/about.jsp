	<h2>About Us</h2>

		How often do we utilize our productive capital being the equipment that we purchase 
		for daily activities as individuals, business, governments, or universities? 
		In Canada, individual households purchase tools only to be used for short periods of time 
		in only parts of the year. What if we technology collectively shifted the narrative of how we 
		utilize this productive capital, opening the idea of building stronger communities through 
		equipment sharing for common benefits. What if we unleashed the capacity of our productive 
		capital to "volunteer" alongside other human volunteers in joint community project? How might
		equipment sharing affect long-term businesses success and competitiveness? How might universities 
		be able to optimize equipment use in times of resource constraints? Ultimately, how might
		a shift in valuing productive capital as having autonomy, as is the trend with autonomous 
		automobiles, potentially increase the productive capacity, competitiveness, and quality of life
		of our communities and our quest for sustainability? Current software lacks this perspective.
